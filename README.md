# es-8 vue controller

A Vue/Vuex app that controls my ES-8 Expert Sleeps analog synth. The webpage is about decision making, influence, and conceptual sound. Unless I decided to a stream of the sound being produced, nobody who is making these edits gets to hear it. I'll just be listening as the few people who see this page start deciding what I'll be hearing.

Also an exercise in creating an interface in paper.js along with getting familiar with a few other technologies (InfluxDB, socket.io).
