# es-8 vue controller

A webpage that controls an analog synth located in my cozy Santa Fe apartment.

It's a project about decision making, influence, and conceptual sound. Unless I decide to add stream of the sound being produced, there will be no way for anyone else to hear it. They certaintly can't come over, not during quarantine.

Created using Vue/Vuex, paper.js, socket.io, InfluxDB, and other fancy whatevers.
